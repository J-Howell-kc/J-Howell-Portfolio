           <h2>About Me</h2>

           <p> Learning to code, more slowly than I'd like. </p>

           <p>I've done an unlikely number of things personally and professionally, from building boats to 
            managing a vintage musical instrument and hi-fi store, 
            marketing copywriting to writing music and pop culture criticism. </p>
            
            <p>After being displaced professionally by COVID and having a spanner thrown in the works by an MS diagnosis,
             I studied project management and earned my CAPM. Now I'm learning to write code as both a bankable skill
              and a means to see an app idea or two through to fruition.</p>

              <p>I like to make things. As a musician and tinkerer, I assemble and play many of my own instruments, and had performances televised by the BBC
                as part of the Experimental Instrument Orchestra in the aughts. Before that, I played guitar and wrote minimalist noisy rock music as one fourth
                 of Esau. These days I continue to tinker with building oddball noisemakers, and occassionally make a bit of film music.</p>
               
          <p>I am a single father of four delightful human beings ranging in age from 33 to 8 and a half.</p>
          
          <p>I know this looks like hot trash right now, but someday it won't.</p>
